## What is AWS?

Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. Think of AWS as a massive collection of computing resources that you can rent and use over the internet instead of buying and maintaining your own physical servers.

### Key Benefits:
- **Cost-effective**: Pay only for what you use
- **Scalable**: Easily scale up or down based on demand
- **Reliable**: 99.99% uptime SLA for many services
- **Secure**: Enterprise-grade security features
- **Global**: Available in multiple regions worldwide

### Cloud Computing Models:
- **IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)**: Raw computing resources (EC2, VPC)
- **PaaS (Platform as a Service)**: Development platforms (Elastic Beanstalk)
- **SaaS (Software as a Service)**: Ready-to-use applications (WorkMail)

## Getting Started

### 1. Creating an AWS Account
1. Visit [aws.amazon.com](https://aws.amazon.com)
2. Click "Create an AWS Account"
3. Provide email, password, and account name
4. Enter contact information
5. Add payment method (credit card required)
6. Verify phone number
7. Choose support plan (Basic is free)

### 2. AWS Free Tier
AWS offers a free tier that includes:
- **12 months free**: Specific amounts of many services
- **Always free**: Limited amounts of certain services forever
- **Trials**: Short-term free trials for other services

Popular free tier services:
- EC2: 750 hours/month of t2.micro instances
- S3: 5GB of storage
- RDS: 750 hours/month of db.t2.micro
- Lambda: 1 million requests/month

### 3. AWS Management Console
The web-based interface to manage all AWS services:
- **Dashboard**: Overview of your resources
- **Services menu**: Access to all AWS services
- **Search**: Quickly find services
- **Notifications**: Important account alerts

## Core AWS Services

### 1. Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)
**What it is**: Virtual servers in the cloud

**Use cases**:
- Web servers
- Application servers
- Development environments
- Testing environments

**Key concepts**:
- **Instances**: Virtual machines
- **AMIs**: Amazon Machine Images (templates)
- **Instance types**: Different CPU, memory, storage combinations
- **Security groups**: Virtual firewalls

**Example instance types**:
- `t2.micro`: 1 vCPU, 1GB RAM (Free tier eligible)
- `t3.small`: 2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM
- `m5.large`: 2 vCPUs, 8GB RAM

### 2. Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)
**What it is**: Object storage service

**Use cases**:
- Website hosting
- Data backup
- Content distribution
- Data archiving

**Key concepts**:
- **Buckets**: Containers for objects
- **Objects**: Files stored in buckets
- **Keys**: Unique identifiers for objects
- **Storage classes**: Different performance/cost tiers

**Storage classes**:
- **Standard**: Frequently accessed data
- **Infrequent Access**: Less frequently accessed
- **Glacier**: Long-term archival
- **Deep Archive**: Lowest cost archival

### 3. Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service)
**What it is**: Managed database service

**Supported engines**:
- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- Oracle
- SQL Server
- MariaDB
- Amazon Aurora

**Benefits**:
- Automated backups
- Software patching
- Monitoring
- Scaling

### 4. Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)
**What it is**: Your own private network in AWS

**Components**:
- **Subnets**: Segments of your VPC
- **Internet Gateway**: Connects VPC to internet
- **Route Tables**: Define traffic routing
- **Security Groups**: Instance-level firewalls
- **NACLs**: Subnet-level firewalls

### 5. AWS Lambda
**What it is**: Serverless computing service

**Use cases**:
- API backends
- File processing
- Real-time data processing
- Scheduled tasks

**Benefits**:
- No server management
- Pay per execution
- Automatic scaling
- Event-driven

### 6. Amazon CloudFront
**What it is**: Content delivery network (CDN)

**Benefits**:
- Faster content delivery
- Global edge locations
- DDoS protection
- SSL/TLS encryption

## AWS Global Infrastructure

### Regions
Geographic areas containing multiple data centers
- **US East (N. Virginia)**: us-east-1
- **US West (Oregon)**: us-west-2
- **Europe (Ireland)**: eu-west-1
- **Asia Pacific (Singapore)**: ap-southeast-1

### Availability Zones (AZs)
Isolated data centers within a region
- Each region has 2-6 AZs
- AZs are connected with high-speed networking
- Deploy across multiple AZs for high availability

### Edge Locations
Smaller data centers for content caching
- Used by CloudFront CDN
- Hundreds of edge locations worldwide

## Pricing and Billing

### Pricing Models
1. **Pay-as-you-go**: Pay for actual usage
2. **Reserved Instances**: Commit to usage for discounts
3. **Spot Instances**: Bid on unused capacity
4. **Savings Plans**: Flexible pricing for compute usage

### Cost Management Tools
- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Visualize spending patterns
- **AWS Budgets**: Set spending alerts
- **Cost and Usage Reports**: Detailed billing data
- **AWS Trusted Advisor**: Cost optimization recommendations

### Example Pricing (US East region):
- **EC2 t2.micro**: $0.0116/hour
- **S3 Standard**: $0.023/GB/month
- **RDS MySQL t2.micro**: $0.017/hour
- **Lambda**: $0.20 per 1M requests

## Security and Identity

### AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM)
**Users**: Individual people or applications
**Groups**: Collections of users
**Roles**: Permissions that can be assumed
**Policies**: JSON documents defining permissions

### Security Best Practices
1. **Enable MFA**: Multi-factor authentication
2. **Principle of least privilege**: Grant minimum necessary permissions
3. **Use IAM roles**: Instead of hardcoding credentials
4. **Regular audits**: Review permissions regularly
5. **Enable CloudTrail**: Log all API calls

### Example IAM Policy:
```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": "s3:GetObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
